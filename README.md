My first GitHub repository!
Hello Odin!

This repo houses an array of directories
Each one dedicated to an assignment within the first few lessons

As I go along, I will continue to keep a consolidated repo for any assignments not specifying to do otherwise

Within the lists folder contains directories for the list assignments found in the list lesson. These lessons stem from the foundations course in the Odin Project.

Additionally, another directory I've made for personal development is the "additional-lists" folder where I've taken it upon myself to slowly digest the material found in Shay Howe's HTML lits tutorial.
