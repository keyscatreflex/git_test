    <h1>Michael's Coding Journey</h1>
    <h2>From total noob to creating a blog</h2>
    <p><strong>10 July 2023</strong></p>
    <p>My journey began trying to figure out what the future holds for me.
        What I mean is, coding was only a hypothetical solution for me at the time I had given it any real thought.
        At the age of thirty-six and having no formal college education, renting out a converted garrage with two kids and a fiance whos been hanging on a thread for a promised marraige, everything looked bleak.

    <p>The only means of income at the time of writing this blog is driving as a rideshare driver for Uber.
        I say reluctantly out of dispair from feeling the pressure of holding everything together like relocating a sand-castle with my bare hands.
        My point is, I'm going to find a way to move that sand-castle, even if I have to acquire a new skill.

    <p>Today I'm involved in The Odin Project curriculumn. im still in the foundations course and have completed 35 percent of it thus far.
        I've also checked out FreeCodeCamp. I can get into the differences and simularities in a different post and link it to this blog.
    </p>
    <p>At this moment, my assignment is to create a blog and use some keyboard shortcuts I've learned and demonstrate <strong>bold</strong> <em>italicized</em> and how to add comments within the code of my html
